New research deals with this research gap using blood transcriptomics, multiparameter flow cytometry, and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing methods."},"links":[{"rel":"alternate","type":"text\/html","href":"https:\/\/www.news-medical.net\/news\/20210406\/Is-non-severe-SARS-CoV-2-infection-characterized-by-early-T-cell-proliferation.aspx"}],"link":"https:\/\/www.news-medical.net\/news\/20210406\/Is-non-severe-SARS-CoV-2-infection-characterized-by-early-T-cell-proliferation.aspx","comments":"https:\/\/www.news-medical.net\/news\/20210406\/Is-non-severe-SARS-CoV-2-infection-characterized-by-early-T-cell-proliferation.aspx#comment","id":"https:\/\/www.news-medical.net\/post.aspx?id=7c76c8bc-b957-46b8-b308-f444cf255fd2","guidislink":false,"published":"2021-04-06T10:25:48.000Z","published_parsed":[2021,4,6,10,25,48,1,96,0],"media_content":[{"url":"https:\/\/d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net\/image-handler\/picture\/2021\/4\/shutterstock_1710087958_(4)-1.jpg","type":"image\/jpeg","expression":"full","width":"1200","height":"800"}],"content":[{"type":"text\/plain","language":null,"base":"https:\/\/www.news-medical.net\/syndication.axd?format=rss","value":"Is non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by early T cell proliferation?"}]}
