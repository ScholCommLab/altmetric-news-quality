24,guardian,"When depression wears a smile, even psychiatrists like me can be deceived | Rebecca Lawrence",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/18/depression-smile-psychiatrists-mental-health-problems,"<p>By the time mental ill health is visible, it’s probably very bad. The best risk assessment is to listen rather than look</p><p>In my everyday life, when I see someone who looks happy, I expect them to feel like that, too. I don’t think about it particularly – it’s a reflex. I glance casually at a smiling face and am reassured that all is well. It takes a conscious effort to remind myself of a fact that psychiatrists know very well on an intellectual level but should perhaps recognise more: a cheerful demeanour can be profoundly misleading.</p><p>The concept of the “happy” depressive is familiar in art and life, with examples ranging from Pagliaccio to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/nov/04/robin-williams-depression-and-dementia-the-clinical-picture"">Robin Williams</a>. It seems strange to think that people can be very depressed – with all the debilitating symptoms that entails – yet manage to hide this, sometimes even from family. Is their depression as real, or as valid, because they manage to go to work, to smile, even to crack a joke? I think it is. There may come a point when even the happy depressive will crack, unable to maintain that facade any longer. But does that mean they suffer less when smiling?

UU. han pedido a la Casa Blanca que ""establezca una directriz uniforme"" para un método de prueba de la inmunidad contra la COVID-19, según una carta que enviaron la semana pasada al coordinador de la respuesta al coronavirus de la Casa Blanca, Jeff Zients. </p><p>Otros países están incluso más adelantados. Por ejemplo, Israel ya emite un pase verde para las personas inmunizadas, que les permite un acceso exclusivo a los eventos deportivos, conciertos, gimnasios, hoteles y restaurantes.</p><p>Las ventajas de un programa de pasaporte son obvias: fomentar el turismo y revigorizar unas economías muy afectadas por la pandemia.</p><p>""Inevitablemente, creo que se crearán estos pasaportes, porque las personas están ansiosas por volver a una sensación de normalidad"", comentó la Dra. Mahshid Abir, investigadora sénior en políticas de los médicos de RAND Corp. ""Tanto desde el lado de la oferta como de la demanda, hay un ímpetu por reencaminar el turismo y los viajes, y volver a algún tipo de normalidad"".</p><p>Pero los pasaportes de vacunación presentan muchas desventajas preocupantes, tantas que la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) se opone a ellos, y hasta ahora la Casa Blanca no ha querido intervenir.</p><p>La semana pasada, el director de emergencias de salud de la OMS, el Dr. Michael Ryan, dijo a los medios noticiosos que los pasaportes de vacunación no deberían usarse como un requisito para los viajes debido a ""unos problemas prácticos y éticos reales"".</p><p>Y el lunes, Andy Slavitt, asesor sénior del equipo de respuesta a la COVID-19 de la Casa Blanca, dijo en una reunión de prensa que ""mantener esos datos y hacer esto no es un rol del gobierno"", cuando se le preguntó sobre los pasaportes de vacunación.</p><p>""Pero sí creemos que cuando se haga, hay una forma correcta y una forma que no es tan buena"", continuó Slavitt. ""Y la forma correcta es que debe ser privado, que los datos deben ser seguros, que el acceso al mismo debe ser gratuito, que debe estar disponible tanto en formato digital como impreso y en varios idiomas, y que debe ser de código abierto"".</p><p><strong>Un medio de persuasión</strong></p><p>Otro beneficio potencial de requerir un pasaporte de vacunación para viajar, comer en un restaurante o asistir a un concierto de rock sería que presionaría a algunas personas que se muestran renuentes ante las vacunas a vacunarse, dijo Abir.</p><p>""Quizá anime a las personas a ponérsela para poder seguir adelante y disfrutar de aspectos de la vida que se están perdiendo"", comentó.</p><p>Pero estos pasaportes también podrían empeorar las desigualdades en todo el mundo, crear preocupaciones sobre unos fraudes descontrolados y la violación de la privacidad, y al final no ayudar a frenar la pandemia, advirtió el Dr. Howard Koh, profesor de la Facultad de Salud Pública T.H. Chan de la Universidad de Harvard, y exsecretario asistente de salud de la administración de Obama.</p><p>""Podría conducir a muchas consecuencias accidentales, sobre todo relacionadas con una ampliación de las divisiones en nuestra sociedad"", dijo Koh.</p><p>En primer lugar, los científicos no saben lo suficiente sobre la inmunidad que ofrece la vacunación como para saber cuánto tiempo sería válido un pasaporte de este tipo, señaló.</p><p>""Un pasaporte de vacunación no necesariamente es un pasaporte de inmunidad"", aclaró Koh. ""Todavía no sabemos exactamente cuánto durará la inmunidad. La inmunidad podría durar muchos años, o ser muchísimo más breve"".</p><p>En cuanto a los pasaportes de vacunación utilizados para viajar entre países, debe haber algún tipo de acuerdo sobre cuáles vacunas son válidas y qué información se requeriría en el documento, añadió Koh.</p><p>La suspensión de la vacuna de AstraZeneca en varios países europeos, debido a preocupaciones sobre los coágulos sanguíneos, muestra que este no es un problema teórico. Cada país ha estado aprobando distintas vacunas para sus poblaciones, y no está claro qué podría significar esto para los viajeros.</p><p>""Si alguien viene aquí y su pasaporte dice que recibió la vacuna de AstraZeneca, ¿qué significa esto respecto a tener un pasaporte estandarizado?"", preguntó Koh.</p><p><strong>Podrían surgir fraudes y disparidades</strong></p><p>La forma que adoptaría un pasaporte de vacunación es otra pregunta abierta.</p><p>El pase verde de Israel tiene formato tanto electrónico como impreso, pero algunos expertos en los viajes han dicho que será imposible ampliar el programa de pasaportes de vacunación a menos que el documento tenga formato digital. ¿Qué significa esto para las personas mayores que no sepan mucho de tecnología, o para las personas pobres que no puedan permitirse un teléfono inteligente?</p><p>""Ya se ha visto lo difícil que ha sido para las poblaciones de personas mayores navegar en los sitios web para obtener acceso a las vacunas"", advirtió Koh. ""Se trata de otra forma de disparidades de las que estamos siendo testigos, no solo respecto a los ingresos, sino también a la edad"".</p><p>Por otra parte, un pasaporte impreso sería vulnerable a los fraudes a menos que se emita como un documento del gobierno a prueba de falsificaciones, como una licencia de conducir, que resultara difícil de duplicar para las personas, anotó Abir.</p><p>Globalmente, un pasaporte de vacunación utilizado para viajar fomentaría el resentimiento contra los países más ricos que tendrán acceso primero a la inmunización contra la COVID-19, añadió Abir, hasta un punto que podría tener ""implicaciones de seguridad nacional"".</p><p>""Si todo el mundo sabe que las personas que viajan al extranjero desde Estados Unidos son las personas vacunadas, y se dirigen a destinos donde quizá no todo el mundo esté vacunado, ¿cuáles serán los sentimientos hacia esos turistas en esos países?"", se preguntó Abir.</p><p>Esto es parte del motivo de que la OMS se opone actualmente a los pasaportes de vacunación, aseguró Ryan. </p><p>""Creo que hay unas consideraciones prácticas y éticas reales que los países tendrán que resolver, porque si el acceso a la vacuna es desigual, entonces la inequidad y la injusticia se pueden arraigar más en el sistema si continuamos tomando decisiones sobre lo que las personas pueden y no pueden hacer, dónde pueden y no pueden ir, basándonos en la vacunación, cuando la vacunación en sí no es algo a lo que todo el mundo tiene el mismo acceso"", apuntó Ryan. </p><p>Hay un argumento final contra los pasaportes de vacunación, dijo Koh: no hay evidencias de que unos documentos de este tipo frenarían la propagación de la COVID-19.</p><p>""Si fuera una forma de reducir la transmisión, sería un resultado ideal, pero todavía no tenemos ninguna evidencia al respecto"", dijo Koh. ""Hay demasiados factores críticos que se desconocen. Cuando comenzamos a observar esto, lo complejo que puede ser nos hace sentirnos humildes"".</p><p><strong>Más información</strong></p><p>Los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE.

""This was mainly related to program viewing rather than playing games.""</p><p>The findings are troubling because preschoolers' use of mobile phones and tablets tripled between 2013 and 2017, with many 4-year-olds now playing games, using apps or watching videos on these devices every day, researchers said in background notes.</p><p>For their study, Paavonen and colleagues examined data on nearly 700 children participating in a long-term pediatric health study in Finland.</p><p>The data showed that 23% of 18-month-olds and 95% of 5-year-olds in Finland spend more than an hour each day on an electronic device, in excess of World Health Organization screen time guidelines.</p><p>By 18 months of age, toddlers were spending an average 32 minutes per day on devices. This increased to 114 minutes a day -- nearly two hours -- by age 5.</p><p>More than two-thirds of 5-year-olds watched shows and movies for more than an hour a day, while about 1 in 10 spent more than an hour a day playing video games.</p><p>Paavonen said the kids who racked up the most screen time were more likely to have:</p><ul class=""ee-ul""><li>Emotional symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, low mood and fearfulness.</li><li>Behavioral symptoms, like quarrels, anger management issues and oppositional behavior.</li><li>Attention problems, such as difficulty concentrating, overactivity and impulsive behavior.</li></ul><p>However, this only held for time spent passively watching shows. These effects were not associated with time spent on video games, after controlling for other factors.</p><p>Viewing programs was associated with a more than doubled risk of hyperactivity; a 91% increased risk of attention and concentration difficulties; and a 71% increased risk of emotional problems, for example.</p><p>There are several potential explanations for these effects, Paavonen said.</p><p>""Screen time may replace significant other activities, like socializing with peers and family members, which can be problematic because children learn social skills by practice in everyday life,"" she said. ""Screen time, particularly in the evening, can replace sleep time, and it is in other studies related to delayed bedtimes and sleep onset problems and thus lack of sleep, which in turn is related to worse emotional regulation.""</p><p>Video games might not produce the same effects as watching shows because they are more interactive, said Dr. Jaeah Chung, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, who reviewed the findings.</p><p>""Some of the games are based on physical activity, like Wii, and others are more based on problem-solving or more interactive,"" she said.</p><p>Chung suggests that parents screen all content for their kids, and watch along with them to make the experience more thoughtful and less passive.</p><p>""Depending on the age, they may not understand what's going on in the media, so it's good to ask questions like what do you think is going on, or how do you think that character felt,"" she said.</p><p>Parents also should limit media use in the house, setting aside mealtimes as screen-free and requiring that kids only use devices in a common area like the living room so they can monitor what's being viewed, Chung added.</p><p>The findings were published March 17 in the journal <em>BMJ Open</em>.</p><p><strong>More information</strong></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has more about <a href=""https://www.healthychildren.org/English/news/Pages/AAP-Announces-New-Recommendations-for-Childrens-Media-Use.aspx"" target=""_blank"">recommended screen time for families</a>.</p><div class=""horizontal-rule""></div><p>SOURCES: Juulia Paavonen, MD, deputy chief physician for child psychiatry, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland; Jaeah Chung, MD, assistant professor, pediatrics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City; <em>BMJ Open</em>, March 17, 2021</p>","Fri, 19 Mar 2021 17:02:11 +0000",

But tests used to determine the dose and effectiveness of treatment can be affected by other medications, including prednisone, prednisolone, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, amiodarone, lithium, interferon-alpha and tamoxifen.</p><p>""Our study highlights the complexity and challenges of managing thyroid hormone replacement in older patients, many of whom are at risk for adverse effects in the context of having multiple chronic conditions and being on multiple other medications,"" said senior researcher Dr. Maria Papaleontiou, an assistant professor at the Institute of Healthcare Policy and Innovation at the University of Michigan.</p><p>For the study, the researchers collected data on more than 538,000 patients age 65 and older who used thyroid hormone and were listed in a U.S. Veterans Health Administration database from 2004 to 2017.</p><p>About 32% were taking medications known to interfere with thyroid function tests. Non-white patients, Hispanics, women and those with other medical conditions were most likely to be doing so. </p><p>Researchers also found that people 85 and older were less likely to be taking thyroid hormone and interfering medications.</p><p>""Thyroid hormone use is common in older adults, and its management is complicated by the fact that many older patients often also use multiple medicines for numerous chronic conditions,"" Papaleontiou said. ""This may increase the risk of drug interactions and the potential for side effects. It is important to be vigilant to ensure safe medication use in our older patients.""</p><p>One expert not part of the study said doctors often overlook the possibility of drugs interacting with thyroid hormone, which can result in either giving too much of the hormone or too little.</p><p>""The fact that certain medications can interfere with the thyroid hormone tests is a very important point to highlight and is often overlooked,"" said Dr. Minisha Sood, an endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>Too little thyroid hormone can weaken or slow the heart, causing fatigue. It can also cause obesity, joint pain, high blood pressure, swelling in the ankles and high cholesterol. Too much thyroid hormone can cause an irregular heartbeat.</p><p>It's important for patients to ask whether certain supplements or medications should be adjusted before they have blood tests to check their thyroid hormone levels, Sood said. Health care providers can use this information to guide patients' medication use.<br /></p><p>""For example, in a patient who has stable thyroid levels for years but then develops low thyroid hormone levels without symptoms of being overmedicated, one might rule out concurrent medications, such as prednisone, as the causative factor,"" Sood said.</p><p>The study findings were scheduled to be presented Thursday at an online meeting of the Endocrine Society.

And that relative sprint toward old age began in their 20s.</p><p>The findings, the study authors said, suggest we need to take a different view of aging.</p><p>""Aging is a lifelong process. It doesn't suddenly begin at the age of 60,"" said lead investigator Maxwell Elliott, a doctoral student at Duke University in Durham, N.C.</p><p>Anyone who has ever known a spry, sharp-as-a-tack 80-year-old -- or a 50-year-old burdened with health problems and disabilities -- knows that chronological age does not tell the whole story.</p><p>The concept of biological aging -- or the speed at which body systems decline over time -- acknowledges that.</p><p>But it's not clear exactly when people begin to diverge in their rate of biological aging, Elliott said.</p><p>The new findings suggest that split happens fairly early in life.</p><p>For the study, Elliott and his colleagues used data on more than 1,000 New Zealanders who have been followed since birth, in the 1970s, to age 45. The pace of their biological aging was tracked starting at age 26, based on measures like body fat, heart fitness, lung capacity, markers of inflammation in the blood, and even cavities.</p><p>It turned out that, indeed, people varied widely in biological aging: The slowest ager gained only 0.4 ""biological years"" for each chronological year in age; in contrast, the fastest-aging participant gained nearly 2.5 biological years for every chronological year.</p><p>And by age 45, rapid biological agers were already showing some health indicators normally associated with old age. Compared with their peers, they moved more slowly, had weaker grip strength, and more problems with balance, vision and hearing.</p><p>Differences in mental sharpness were clear, too, the researchers found.</p><p>On average, rapid agers scored lower on tests of memory performance, and they generally reported more forgetfulness in daily life. Meanwhile, MRI scans showed they typically had more signs of brain-tissue thinning.</p><p>The findings were published online March 15 in the journal <em>Nature Aging</em>.</p><p>Elliott said he was surprised by the extent of the aging differences at the relatively young age of 45.</p><p>And, he said, they were significant enough for people to notice them in daily life. Rapid agers typically said they felt older than they were, for example, and doubted they would live to see the age of 75.</p><p>If that weren't enough, they also looked older than their age, based on independent raters who viewed study participants' facial images.</p><p>Dr. Sofiya Milman is director of human longevity studies at Albert Einstein College of Medicine's Institute for Aging Research, in New York City.</p><p>Like Elliott, she noted that aging does not ""magically start at age 60.""</p><p>""Aging is a continuum,"" said Milman, who reviewed the findings. ""And it probably starts even earlier than we've recognized.""</p><p>As for what determines a person's rate of biological aging, Milman said genes play a role. There are certain ""longevity genes"" that can help shield people from environmental stressors, to a degree.</p><p>But aging is not set in stone. Both Milman and Elliott said environment matters, from lifestyle choices to exposures to chronic stress and poverty.</p><p>It's clear that regular exercise, a healthy diet and not smoking can reduce the risks of various diseases.
